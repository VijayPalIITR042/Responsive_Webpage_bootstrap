                          <p> It was one of those perfect southern California afternoons, the sun peeking through a thick grove of trees, the air just a touch autumnal. I was eating lunch with the novelist TC Boyle in the backyard of his Frank Lloyd Wright–designed house in Montecito, the posh enclave of Santa Barbara in California where he has lived for more than two decades, raising three children with his wife of 42 years. His black puli, Ilka, played happily on the deck. “It’s quite clear to me that our species is on the way out,” Boyle said casually, as if the scene had grown just a little too suburban. It is the novelist’s job, after all, to jostle us out of our comforts, while being entertaining – that is, to make discomfort pleasurable.</p>

Then again, no place may be more aware of its precariousness than this state blessed by so much bounty and fraught with so much danger. In the north, wildfires were burning. Earlier that day, I had driven past Lake Cachuma, which Boyle pointed out was at only about 10 percent capacity because of California’s years-long drought. And there was going to be an earthquake. Probably a tsunami too, with the occasional mudslide and windstorm to keep things interesting. “It looks pretty damn grim to me,” Boyle said as we popped cubes of salty cheese into our mouths and sipped our carbonated water. “Maybe we better get some colonies going real fast.”</p>
